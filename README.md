# 💼 CodeTech Internship – Data Analysis Domain

**COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
**NAME**: UNNAM DEDEEPYA
**INTERN ID**: CT08DM210
**DOMAIN**: DATA ANALYSIS
**DURATION**: 8 WEEKS
**MENTOR**: NEELA SANTOSH

Welcome to my CodeTech Internship Portfolio! Over the course of this internship, I tackled four major tasks in the data analysis domain — from building dashboards to performing machine learning and big data analysis. This journey helped me strengthen my data science skills and apply them to real-world problems.

## ✅ Task 1: Dashboard Development (Power BI)

**Objective**: Build an interactive, insight-driven dashboard to explore customer loan behavior.

**Key Activities**:
- Connected to banking loan dataset
- Cleaned and categorized columns (e.g., `Education`, `Family`, `Online`)
- Created slicers and groupings (e.g., income bins, age bins)
- Designed interactive KPIs: loan approval %, avg income, credit card spend
- Visualized data with tree maps, bar charts, conversion funnels
- Used navigation buttons and visual-level filters

**Tools Used**: Power BI  
**Outcome**: Delivered a business-friendly dashboard with meaningful visuals and interactive insights.

## ✅ Task 2: Sentiment Analysis (Twitter US Airline Dataset)

**Objective**: Analyze customer sentiment from tweets and classify them using machine learning.

**Key Activities**:
- Cleaned tweets (removed URLs, mentions, punctuation)
- Visualized positive, negative, and neutral tweet distribution
- Generated word clouds for each sentiment
- Built ML models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM
- Evaluated models (accuracy ~80% with Logistic Regression)

**Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NLTK, Scikit-learn  
**Outcome**: Logistic Regression chosen as final model with solid sentiment classification.

## ✅ Task 3: Predictive Analysis (Diabetes Prediction)

**Objective**: Predict the likelihood of diabetes from patient health indicators.

**Key Activities**:
- Replaced invalid values (e.g., 0s in glucose/BMI) with medians
- Engineered features like `Glucose_BMI` and `Age_Group`
- Built and evaluated multiple models (Logistic Regression, RF, SVM)
- Achieved ~76% accuracy with Logistic Regression

**Tools Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Seaborn , Jupyter Notebook
**Outcome**: Built an effective prediction pipeline and explained dataset limitations for medical prediction.

## ✅ Task 4: Big Data Analysis (Amazon Mobile Reviews)

**Objective**: Analyze a large dataset of mobile reviews using PySpark.

**Key Activities**:
- Handled messy CSV rows (long unquoted reviews)
- Cleaned and converted `Price`, `Rating`, `Review Votes` to numeric
- Replaced missing values with column means
- Grouped and exported insights: top brands, avg rating, price distribution
- Downloaded cleaned results and visualized trends

**Tools Used**: PySpark, Google Colab, Pandas, Matplotlib  
**Outcome**: Demonstrated large-scale data processing, cleaning, and aggregation with PySpark.
